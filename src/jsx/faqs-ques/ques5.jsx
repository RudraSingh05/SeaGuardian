                        After clicking on the "Take Action" button, you'll find yourself on a dedicated page designed specifically for reporting incidents. Your first step is to provide your personal credentials to ensure accuracy and follow-up.

                        Next, you'll be prompted to describe the location of the incident in detail. This should include specifics such as the address or nearby landmarks to pinpoint the exact area. Additionally, you'll need to specify the type of pollution observed, whether it's air, water, or land pollution, and provide a brief description of the situation.<br /><br />
                        To enhance the report and provide clearer understanding, you'll also have the option to attach an image related to the incident. This could be a photo showcasing the pollution, the affected area, or any other relevant visuals that support your report.<br /><br />
